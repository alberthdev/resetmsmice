# About this package
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This package, resetmsmice, fixes scroll wheel issues with certain Wireless Microsoft mice in X.org (includes KDE & Gnome applications), where the vertical wheel scrolls abnormally fast. Only needed if you dual boot between Microsoft Windows and some linux distro.
# Known to fix the vertical scroll wheel issue with the following models (and others related):
#    Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500
#    Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000
# This program basically just resets a setting in the mouse through usb communications and then exits. Only if the mouse matches vendor [0x045e] (Microsoft) and product code [0x0745] (a series of Microsoft Wireless mice) it will check for this usb setting.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Software requirements to compile 'resetmsmice':
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1) pkg-config
#    In Ubuntu, Kubuntu, or Mint Linux this package is called: pkg-config
#    You can get it through synaptic, or on the command line as root type this:
sudo apt-get install pkg-config
#
#    In Fedora, and probably Centos and Redhat as well, as root, type this on the command line: 
yum install pkgconfig
#
#    If you are on another distro and can't seem to find a package for pkgconfig, grab it here:
#    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config
#    You will need to compile pkg-config and install it if your distro doesn't have a package.
#
# 2) libusb-1.0 development files
#    In Ubuntu, Kubuntu, or Mint Linux this package is called: libusb-1.0-0-dev
#    You can get it through synaptic if you have it installed or on the command line:
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
#
#    In Fedora, Centos, or Redhat, type the following as root:
yum install libusb1-devel
#
#    If you can't seem to find this package in your distro's package manager,
#    you can grab the tarball here:
#    http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/files/libusb-1.0/
#
#    I use libusb-1.0.8, but anything after that should work as well.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Compiling and installing this package:
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Open a command line, and cd into the directory you untarred this package then type:
./configure
make
make install

# If configure or make error out, make sure you have the software requirements above.
# The make install command will need to be run with the root account, in Ubuntu, sudo make install

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To have the package run on system bootup
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# First you will need to compile the package and install it, as shown above.
# To enable resetmsmice to run on boot, please run 'resetmsmice-enable-boot.sh' with one of the following options:

# If you run a recent version of Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Mint Linux, or any other Linux distro that runs upstart:
resetmsmice-enable-boot.sh --upstart

# If you run a recent version Fedora or OpenSUSE or any other Linux distro that uses systemd and want systemd to launch resetmsmice automatically on bootup run:
resetmsmice-enable-boot.sh --systemd

# If you run Debian, Redhat, or any other distro that uses System V style startup scripts and launch resetmsmice automatically on bootup run:
resetmsmice-enable-boot.sh --sysv

# Don't know what option to use!!!!? 
#
# System V startup scripts are fairly common and a lot of distros still keep it for backwards compatitibility so if you don't know what type of startup scripts your system uses, as root, try running:
resetmsmice-enable-boot.sh --sysv

#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To disable resetmsmice from starting on bootup
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# On the command line: resetmsmice-enable-boot.sh --disable
#
# This will stop resetmsmice from running on bootup.
